What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Initializing a repository creates a .git folder in the folder/directory/repository.
  The .git folder is hidden form normal view because it has a '.' in front of the
  file name. The .git folder holds the metadata that will keep track of the
  different versions of the files that have been committed. The repository must
  be initialized so that the metadata about the files can be stored in the
  .git folder.
