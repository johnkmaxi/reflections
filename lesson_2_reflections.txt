What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Initializing a repository creates a .git folder in the folder/directory/repository.
  The .git folder is hidden form normal view because it has a '.' in front of the
  file name. The .git folder holds the metadata that will keep track of the
  different versions of the files that have been committed. The repository must
  be initialized so that the metadata about the files can be stored in the
  .git folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is kind of a weird place. It holds files that haven't been
  committed yet, but the files are still being worked on. I haven't decided
  if the files in the staging area are being tracked? I think it means the files
  are being tracked now that they are in the staging area. Thus, when those files
  are committed, there is metadata available about them. So, I'm not sure what
  value it adds yet. I guess the assumption is that you create a file and then
  add it to the staging area, so there hasn't been sufficient work done on the
  file to justify making a commit. By adding the file to the staging area,
  data about the changes can be tracked leading up to the first commit.
