When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  The remote repository is a good option for collaboration with other people, or
  for working with files acorss different computers. Maybe using a desktop at
  work and a laptop at home? Or vice-versa. The remote repository also allows
  you to share the code with people you might not know if you are building a new
  library for a programming language.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  The remote repository might have collaborators working on it. If all the
  changes are always pulled automatically it might mess up the local files.
  Being able to have control over what files are moved from the remote to the
  local branch would prevent things from getting over-written accidentally.
