When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  The remote repository is a good option for collaboration with other people, or for working with files acorss different computers.
  Maybe using a desktop at work and a laptop at home? Or vice-versa. The remote repository also allows you to share the code with people
  you might not know if you are building a new library for a programming language.
